Estimated Cost = (Hours × ₱1,200) × 0.25

The 0.25 multiplier is the AI efficiency factor (75% faster)
```

**Examples:**

---

## Business Model Decisions You Need to Make

### 1. How Will You Make Money?

**Option A: Commission on Transactions**
- Charge 5-15% of each quote value
- Example: ₱10,000 test → ₱500-1,500 commission
- **Pros:** Aligned incentives, scalable revenue
- **Cons:** Need payment integration, escrow complexity

**Option B: Subscription Fees for Labs**
- Charge ₱5,000-15,000/month per lab
- Example: 50 labs × ₱10,000 = ₱500,000/month revenue
- **Pros:** Predictable recurring revenue
- **Cons:** Harder to justify before network effects

**Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- Small subscription (₱3,000-5,000/month) + low commission (3-5%)
- Example: 50 labs × ₱5,000 = ₱250,000/month base + transaction fees
- **Pros:** Stable base + growth upside
- **Cons:** More complex pricing

**System is Ready For:** Any of the above (just need your decision)

---

### 2. How to Prevent Platform Leakage?

**Problem:** Clients might go direct to labs after first transaction (bypass your platform)

**Solutions:**

**Contractual (Cheap):**
- Non-circumvention clauses in Terms of Service
- **Cost:** ₱0 (just legal language)
- **Effectiveness:** 30-50% (depends on enforcement)

**Value-Add (Moderate):**
- Provide services labs can't replicate alone
- Examples: Multi-lab RFQ, escrow, analytics, reputation system
- **Cost:** ₱200,000-400,000 (Stage 3 features)
- **Effectiveness:** 70-80% (clients stay for convenience)

**Exclusive Contracts (Expensive):**
- Labs agree to only use PipetGo for certain service types
- Higher commission justified by exclusivity
- **Cost:** ₱0 (contractual)
- **Effectiveness:** 90%+ (but harder to recruit labs)

**My Recommendation:** Start with contractual + build value-add features in Stage 3

---

### 3. Pricing Transparency?

**Question:** Should clients see reference prices before requesting quotes?

**Option A: Full Transparency**
- Show reference prices for all services
- **Pros:** Faster decisions, attracts price-sensitive clients
- **Cons:** Labs might not like price visibility

**Option B: Quote-Only**
- Hide all prices, everything requires custom quote
- **Pros:** Protects lab pricing strategies
- **Cons:** Slower decision-making, higher friction

**Option C: Hybrid (Current System)**
- Labs choose: FIXED (show price) or QUOTE_REQUIRED (hide price)
- **Pros:** Flexibility, market will decide
- **Cons:** Inconsistent user experience

**System Currently Supports:** Option C (hybrid)
**Your Decision Needed:** Mandate transparency, stay hybrid, or force opacity?

---

### "How much will it cost to maintain?"

**Monthly Operational Costs (Stage 1):**
```
Neon Database (free tier):              ₱0
Vercel Hosting (free tier):             ₱0
Email (SendGrid free tier):             ₱0

Domain (pipetgo.com):                   ₱100/month
                                       ────────
TOTAL:                                  ₱100/month

TOTAL:                                  ₱8,400/month
```

**Still Affordable:** Way cheaper than traditional hosting (₱30,000-50,000/month)

---

### "What if I need changes or fixes?"

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Cost:** Included for first 30 days after delivery
- **After 30 days:** ₱1,200/hr (typically 1-2 hours per bug)

**Small Changes (UI tweaks, text updates):**
- **Cost:** ₱1,200-5,000 per change
- **Timeline:** 1-3 days

**New Features:**
- **Cost:** Use ballpark estimates above
- **Process:** I'll provide written estimate before starting

**Retainer Option:**
- **Cost:** ₱20,000-40,000/month
- **Includes:** 10-20 hours of maintenance, small features, priority support
- **Good For:** Active development phase (Stage 2-3)

---

### "How do I compare this to other quotes?"

**Red Flags in Other Quotes:**
- Price too low (<₱300,000): Probably cutting corners on quality
- No testing mentioned: You'll get bugs in production
- No documentation: Impossible to maintain later
- No timeline: Projects drag on for months
- Pay upfront: Risk of non-delivery

**What to Look For:**
- Written timeline with milestones
- Automated testing mentioned
- Documentation deliverables specified
- Payment tied to milestones
- References from previous projects

**My Quote Stands Out:**
- 73% below market rate
- Already delivered (not just promises)
- 233 automated tests (proof of quality)
- 36,468 lines of documentation (proof of thoroughness)
- Family trust + market professionalism
