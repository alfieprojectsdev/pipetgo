## 7. REVENUE MODEL TO COVER COSTS

### 7.1 Market Context: Philippine Lab Testing Industry

**Market Size Indicators:**
- ISO 17025 certified labs in Philippines: **~150-200 labs** (source: PAB directory)
- Target addressable market: **Mid-sized labs (10-50 employees)** = ~50-75 labs
- Average testing service price range: **₱3,000 - ₱50,000** per order
- Quote-to-order conversion rate (B2B marketplaces): **30-60%** (industry benchmark)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- **Current state:** Mostly offline (email, phone quotes)
- **Pain points:** Manual quoting (time-consuming), no centralized tracking, lost quotes in email
- **Your advantage:** First-mover in quotation-focused lab marketplace

### 7.2 Revenue Model Options Analysis

Based on marketplace research (see documents), three viable models:

#### Option A: Commission Only (Not Recommended for PH Labs)

| Metric | Value | Why It's Challenging |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Commission rate** | 10-15% | High friction for labs already operating on thin margins |
| **Average order** | ₱15,000 | Commission = ₱1,500-2,250 per order |
| **Platform leakage risk** | HIGH | Labs will bypass platform after first transaction |
| **Value prop needed** | Insurance, escrow, invoicing automation | Complex for Stage 1 |

**Research Finding:** Commission-only works best when you provide significant transaction value (like Airbnb's insurance or Uber's payment automation). For B2B with high-value orders, labs perceive commission as "expensive" unless you deliver tools they can't get elsewhere.

---

#### Option B: Subscription Only (Low Revenue Potential)

| Metric | Value | Risk Assessment |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Monthly fee** | ₱2,000-5,000 | Hard to justify without proven customer volume |
| **Target labs** | 10-15 in Year 1 | Total revenue: ₱20K-75K/month |
| **Chicken-egg problem** | CRITICAL | Labs won't pay subscription without seeing customers; customers won't come without labs |

**Research Finding:** Subscription works for platforms that already have liquidity (established user base). For early-stage marketplaces, subscription creates artificial barrier to supply acquisition.

---

#### Option C: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED) ✅

| Component | Rate | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Base subscription** | ₱1,500/month | Covers platform costs, low enough to reduce entry friction |
| **Transaction fee** | 3-5% | Lower than pure commission models (10-15%), reduces bypass incentive |
| **First 3 months** | FREE | Critical for solving chicken-egg problem - lets you prove value before charging |

**Why Hybrid Works for PipetGo:**
1. **Base revenue even with low volume:** ₱1,500/month × 10 labs = ₱15K predictable income
2. **Lower transaction fee (3-5% vs 10-15%)** keeps labs happy, reduces platform leakage
3. **Scales with usage:** As labs get more orders, your revenue grows proportionally
4. **Philippine market fit:** Labs can budget ₱1,500/month (cost of 1 employee lunch week), while 3-5% feels "fair" vs 15%

### 7.3 Realistic Financial Projections (Hybrid Model)

#### Conservative Scenario (Most Likely)

**Assumptions:**
- Start with 3 pilot labs (free for 3 months)
- Grow to 10 paying labs by Month 12
- Average 15 orders/month per lab by Month 12
- Average order value: ₱12,000
- Conversion rate: 40% (quote requests → completed orders)

**Month-by-Month Projection:**

| Month | Pilot Labs (Free) | Paying Labs | Orders/Month | Subscription Revenue | Transaction Revenue (3%) | Total Revenue | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1-3 | 3 | 0 | 10 | ₱0 | ₱3,600 | ₱3,600 | ₱10,800 |
| 4-6 | 3 | 3 | 30 | ₱4,500 | ₱10,800 | ₱15,300 | ₱56,700 |
| 7-9 | 0 | 6 | 60 | ₱9,000 | ₱21,600 | ₱30,600 | ₱148,500 |
| 10-12 | 0 | 10 | 120 | ₱15,000 | ₱43,200 | ₱58,200 | ₱322,700 |

**Year 1 Results:**
- **Total Revenue:** ₱322,700
- **Infrastructure Costs:** ₱86,500
- **Your Sweat Equity:** ₱662,000 (35% equity value)
- **Net Cash Position:** ₱236,200 (covers infrastructure + some operational buffer)

**Key Insight:** You reach marketplace liquidity around Month 6-9 when you have enough labs to consistently match client requests with qualified suppliers. This is when network effects kick in.

---

#### Moderate Scenario (If Product-Market Fit Strong)

**Assumptions:**
- Faster adoption: 15 labs by Month 12
- Higher order volume: 20 orders/month per lab
- Same average order value: ₱12,000

**Month 12 Snapshot:**
- **Subscription revenue:** 15 labs × ₱1,500 = **₱22,500/month**
- **Transaction revenue:** (15 labs × 20 orders) × ₱12,000 × 3% = **₱108,000/month**
- **Total Monthly Revenue:** **₱130,500**
- **Annual Run Rate:** **₱1.57M**

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** ~₱650,000 (ramping up from ₱0 → ₱130K/month)

---

#### Aggressive Scenario (Requires Strong Execution + Market Timing)

**Assumptions:**
- 25 labs by Month 12
- 25 orders/month per lab
- Higher average order: ₱15,000 (more complex tests)

**Month 12 Snapshot:**
- **Subscription:** 25 × ₱1,500 = **₱37,500**
- **Transaction:** (25 × 25) × ₱15,000 × 3% = **₱281,250**
- **Total:** **₱318,750/month**
- **Annual Run Rate:** **₱3.8M**

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** ~₱1.2M

---

### 7.4 Break-Even Analysis (Hybrid Model)

#### Immediate Costs to Cover (Year 1):

| Cost Category | Amount | Covered By |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | ₱86,500/year | Need 58 orders OR 5 labs paying ₱1,500 for 12 months |
| **Your Sister's Cash Outlay** | ₱86,500 | Recovered by Month 7-9 (conservative scenario) |
| **Your Sweat Equity** | ₱662,000 | Converted to 35% equity (₱0 cash needed) |

**Infrastructure Break-Even:**
- **Subscription-only:** 58 months × ₱1,500 = 4.8 labs paying for 12 months
- **Transaction-only:** ₱86,500 / (₱12,000 × 3%) = 241 orders
- **Hybrid (realistic):** 5 labs + 80 orders = **Month 6-7 break-even** âœ…

**Critical Insight:** The hybrid model creates multiple revenue streams, so you're not dependent on either high lab count OR high transaction volume. You can break even with moderate growth in both.

### 7.5 Liquidity Timeline (When Platform "Works")

**Marketplace liquidity** = the likelihood that a transaction happens when supply meets demand. For PipetGo:

**Month 1-3 (Pre-Liquidity):**
- 3 pilot labs, limited service coverage
- Client requests may not find matching lab
- **Liquidity score:** ~20% (1 in 5 requests matched)

**Month 4-6 (Threshold Liquidity):**
- 6-8 labs, broader service categories
- Most common tests (water quality, tensile strength) covered
- **Liquidity score:** ~50% (1 in 2 requests matched)
- **This is your tipping point** âœ…

**Month 7-12 (Sustainable Liquidity):**
- 10-15 labs, comprehensive coverage
- Network effects activate: more labs → more clients → more labs want to join
- **Liquidity score:** 70-80% (most requests matched)
- **Word-of-mouth growth kicks in**

**Key Research Finding:** You don't need 100 labs to succeed. You need 10-15 well-matched labs with complementary specializations to achieve 70%+ liquidity. Focus on **quality supply, not quantity**.

---

### 7.6 Platform Leakage Risk Assessment

**Platform leakage** (or disintermediation) = when users bypass your payment system to transact directly, cutting you out of revenue.

**High-Risk Scenario (Why Commission-Only Fails):**
```
Month 1: Client requests quote via PipetGo
Month 1: Lab provides quote, client approves (you earn 15% commission = ₱1,800)
Month 2: Client contacts lab directly via email
Month 2-12: Lab and client transact 10 more times (you earn ₱0)
Result: You lost ₱18,000 in potential revenue
```

**Hybrid Model Mitigation:**
The ₱1,500/month subscription + low 3% fee provides better value proposition:

1. **Lab's perspective:** "I'm already paying ₱1,500/month for the platform. Why risk losing access by bypassing it for 3% savings?"
2. **Your value adds (prevents leakage):**
   - Centralized order tracking (lab can't do this via email)
   - Automated quote management (saves lab time)
   - Certified report delivery system (client prefers this)
   - Review system building lab reputation

**Leakage Prevention Tactics (from research):**
- **Build trust mechanisms:** Reviews, ratings, lab verification
- **Make transaction easier on platform than off:** One-click re-orders, saved client info
- **Educate labs:** "Platform fees keep PipetGo running and bringing you new clients"
- **Don't be draconian:** Avoid blocking contact info exchange (creates resentment). Instead, make platform so valuable they don't want to leave.

| **Profit margin** | Break-even | 20-30% | 30-40% |

**Stage 2 Success = Profitability + Foundation for Scale**

---

#### Stage 3 (Year 2): Scale & Optimization
**Goal:** Become dominant lab marketplace in Philippines

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active labs | 40-50 |
| Orders/month | 800-1,000 |
| Monthly revenue | ₱500,000-750,000 |
| Team size | 5-8 people (support, sales, dev) |
| **Funding decision** | Raise seed round OR stay bootstrapped |
