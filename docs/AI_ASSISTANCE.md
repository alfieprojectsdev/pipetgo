# AI Assistance

Some commits in this repository were assisted using AI tools, including Claude Code for debugging sessions.

## Scope of AI Assistance

AI tools were used to assist with:

- **Code Review & Refactoring:** Identifying technical debt and suggesting improvements
- **Test Development:** Writing comprehensive test suites for authentication and security features
- **Documentation:** Creating architecture decision records (ADRs) and implementation plans
- **Security Implementation:** Password authentication, rate limiting, and timing attack prevention
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Component design and accessibility improvements

## Human Oversight

All AI-assisted code and documentation underwent human review and testing before being committed to the repository. Final decisions on architecture, implementation approach, and code quality were made by the development team.
